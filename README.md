# Road Traffic Severity Classification Project
- The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents of the year 2017. It has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms.



- The First step performed was EDA followed by different visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.
Created and cleared crucial Hypothesis based on the data to extract out which features affected the severity the most.



- Then the model is trained on 2 different ML Algorithms which are XGBoost and Random Forrest to determine which one has the higher accuracy of predictions


- Lastly we finish off with some Hyperparameter Tuning, pre-processing and feature engineering to further enhance the accuracy.
